/**
 * Provides useful NCCO classes which can be serialized using Jackson when
 * implementing webhooks to drive the Vonage Voice API.
 * <p>
 * The simplest way to use these classes is to subclass {@link com.nexmo.client.voice.servlet.AbstractAnswerServlet}
 * and implement {@link com.nexmo.client.voice.servlet.AbstractAnswerServlet#handleRequest(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)}.
 * the returned NCCOResponse will automatically be serialized correctly.
